#Coup (SCAD)

Containers to organize and protect the contents of the game Coup.

##About

The project provides a set of models that are designed to fit neatly into the
box of the Coup card game (not the expansion, Coup: Reformation).  The internal
box dimensions are 103mmx145mmx25mm.

The project makes the assumption that the cards are sleeved using 88mmx100mm
card sleeves, adding thickness to the stack and protecting them from any
possible scratches by plastic pieces.
